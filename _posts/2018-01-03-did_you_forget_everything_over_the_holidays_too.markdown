Last year (more like 6 months ago), when I decided to attend Flatiron School, I was *so* pumped about it. As someone who never finished their bachelor's degree, I was thrilled to find a way to pursue gainful employment without having to go back to college and sit through all of the b.s. courses that barely related to my major. (Seriously, Universities, why do you do that??)

Anyway, once the initial excitement wore off I realized I had no real plan and I coded intermittently with weeks of distraction in between. If you haven't experienced this yet, what you'll find is that when you come back you basically have to re-learn everything you thought you already knew. I was convinced that nothing was sticking and that *maybe* coding just wasn't for me. Until I stumbled upon someone who said almost the same exact thing on Slack.

Thank you, random Slack person. You rescued me. Since then, I've seen this echoed many times and I've made more of concerted effort to make sure I'm doing at least a little bit of coding multiple times a week. And guess what? It's sticking!
