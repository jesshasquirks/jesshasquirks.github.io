I'm a self-taught graphic designer. I've been working on my online degree in Graphic Design but most of what I know and do, I learned on my own. I started first as a wedding stationery designer. I had a beautiful website designed and developed but when I tried to edit it, I realized that I had no clue what I was doing.

I love figuring things out on my own so I pulled up my best friend Google and went to work. I really liked being able to use characters and symbols to alter things at my will and so when I stumbled upon Skillcrush.com I immediately bought a Blueprint and got to work.

Soon, I realized that I loved coding more than I loved stationery. There was something almost therapeutic about opening and closing tags. Something empowering in knowing that I was capable of making a website from scratch. And realizing that I had a love and skill for something that would make me an asset in the tech world? Oh yeah, sign me up.

And so, here I am. A few years after discovering that coding is fun. I took the plunge and enrolled in the Flatiron School and am well on my way down a brand new path.
